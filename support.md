Hi, some of you may be wondering how can you support me in my ministry.

## In Prayer
I always apprecate prayer for my ministry.

Please pray for opportunities to:

- share the gospel faithfully
- pray for those needing healing
- to hear God clearly
- revelation, wisdom and safety during deliverance ministry
