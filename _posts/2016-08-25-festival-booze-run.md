# Riverside Outreach – Wednesday 25th 2016

Ian Stanley (from [Reading Family Church](http://www.readingfamilychurch.org.uk) and part of The Turning Team) will be leading a group into the town centre to witness to the many who stray into town.

On Thursday and Friday late mornings/ lunchtimes most Festival-goers turn up at Tesco's, Oxford Road to stock up on alcohol for the week. After queuing in Tesco's they normally relax on the grass outside before slowly making their way back to site.

I am leading a team of Christians who wish to do some 1-2-1 witnessing (and exercising their prophecy and healing gifts if appropriate).

## Meet

Meet at *The Gate, Oxford Road* (553 Oxford Road, RG30 1HJ) at 11:30 for a short time of prayer before we go out.

Some members of the team  will be there from 10:30 to train anybody who wants to join in the evangelism but feels unprepared.
Limited parking is available at The Gate and .
