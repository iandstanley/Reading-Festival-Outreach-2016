# Riverside Outreach – Wednesday 25th 2016

Ian Stanley (from [Reading Family Church](http://www.readingfamilychurch.org.uk) and part of The Turning Team) will be leading a group into the town centre to witness to the many who stray into town.

We welcome those Christians who wish to do some 1-2-1 witnessing (and exercising their prophecy and healing gifts if appropriate).

## Meet

Meet at the (Carey Centre)[http://www.careybaptistchurch.org.uk/] for prayer at 11:00am **????** hiring the streets shortly after. Car parking is available at the Carey Centre. 

Some members of the team  will be there from 10:30 to train anybody who wants to join in the evangelism but feels unprepared.

## Parking

Limited parking is available at the [Carey Centre](http://www.careybaptistchurch.org.uk/about/contact/)

Alternative parking is available at [Q-Park in Chatham Place](http://www.q-park.co.uk/parking/reading/q-park-chatham-place).


## Afterwards ...
We will break for lunch part way through the day to share and encourage others and to eat lunch.

## Outreach Promo Video
We have a [video](http://shinny.co.uk/severn/videos/prereading2015v3.mov) produced last year by one of our techie members at Reading Family Church (running time 2:50). Please feel free to use to advertise the outreach.
