Meet at 10am at The Gate's Oxford Road site (553 Oxford Road, Reading RG30 1HJ) for a short training session on how to evangelize and then to hit the streets to witness for an hour.

The Turning have trained over 800 Christians on how to witness and have seen over

UPDATE:

We took 25 people out to witness around Broad street in Reading. During that one hour we saw 37 people make a first time commitment saying the salvation prayer.
