Ian Stanley (from [Reading Family Church](http://www.readingfamilychurch.org.uk) and part of The Turning Team) will be leading a group down by the River Thames on the side of the Festival site to do some 1-2-1 witnessing (and exercising their prophecy and healing gifts if appropriate) – all are welcome including first timers.

In addition, Jamie Cater from [Carey Baptist Church](http://www.careybaptistchurch.org.uk) will be taking a team out to the Riverside to witness as well.
