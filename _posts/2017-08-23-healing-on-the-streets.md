During Healing on the Streets I got the opportunity to pray with a couple of ladies over some issues they wanted prayer for.

One of the ladies asked me to pray for a blood problem she had. I prayed and she felt some peace but due to the nature of the problem we were unable to ascertain if anything had happened without waiting for medical tests. During this prayer God told me she had a problem with her knee. I offered to pray. Prayed and then asked her to test it. She was still in a lot of discomfort and I felt prompted to prophesy over her knee that it would be completely healed before she got up to leave Broad Street.

I returned to talking to others and then eventually noticed she was about to leave. I checked in with her and her arthritis had gone.
