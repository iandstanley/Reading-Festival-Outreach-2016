# Riverside Outreach – Sunday 28th 2016

The Turning Team will be unavailable for this session as they are traveling to Liverpool to run evangelism training for 2 weeks with daily soaking and outreach sessions. Please keep them in your prayers and that God will open up the hearts of the people of Liverpool.

Jamie Cater from [Carey Baptist Church](http://www.careybaptistchurch.org.uk) will be taking a team out to the Riverside to witness.
