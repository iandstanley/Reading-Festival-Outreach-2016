In beautiful Swansea this week for a short mission to reach the people of Swansea.

This mission's secondary aim is to iron out any issues prior to New Wine Cymru's nationwide mission to Wales happening in July. New Wine Cymru are hoping to see 10,000 people ask Jesus to be their Lord and Saviour across 30 towns and cities in Wales.
