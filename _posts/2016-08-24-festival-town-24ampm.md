Ian Stanley (from [Reading Family Church](http://www.readingfamilychurch.org.uk) and part of The Turning Team) will be leading a group into the town centre to witness to the many who stray into town.

We welcome those Christians who wish to do some 1-2-1 witnessing (and exercising their prophecy and healing gifts if desired).

## Meet

Meet at the [Carey Centre](http://www.careybaptistchurch.org.uk/) for prayer at 11:00am hitting the streets shortly after.

Some members of the team  will be there from 10:30 to train anybody who wants to join in the evangelism but feels unprepared.

We will be taking a lunch break around 1pm and resuming around 1:30.

Carey Baptist will be continuing until about 5pm and you are welcome to continue with them.

## Also happening ...
Carey are running a drinks stall EVERY DAY near the festival site (10am—5pm) — please contact Jamie Cater on 07810 132805 to join in with this.
