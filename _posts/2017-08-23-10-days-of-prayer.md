I am involved with (running the ministry team) an initiative to run an event calling the church in Reading, England to come together as one body ─ the bride of Jesus Christ to join together in prayer for the church, the town of Reading, and the nation.

The event is being lead by a gentleman called Tim Doolan. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">His dream is to bring the church together in prayer in the spirit of 2 Chronicles 7:14</span>

## What Is 10 Days of Prayer?

Ten Days of Prayer is about TESHUVA ─ about Turning. Turning away from our ways and seeking God’s face. Seeking God’s face can be a conversation with God and that can be quite creative. We expect Prayer, Worship and Celebration to be a part of that conversation. It is an opportunity to come together and meet with God. After all He promises

If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.

Don’t miss the beginning of this verse … IT STARTS WITH IF ─ it’s an invite

**You are invited to 10 DAYS OF PRAYER.**

<blockquote>Imagine if your town stopped for 10 Days to seek God’s face …<br><br>Imagine if YOU, YOUR CHURCH, YOUR TOWN<br> stopped for 10 Days to seek God’s face …<br><br>IF …</blockquote>

## When is 10 Days of Prayer?

The event will run from the 20th to the 30th of September 2017 in the Reading Abbey Grounds where pilgrims once gathered for hundreds of years. While the Abbey is restored we thought we’d celebrate by restoring the temple too. That’s those who are called by His name of course!
