During the meeting I started feeling a weight on my shoulders and neck as if I had put a heavy yoke on them. I mentioned this to the group and one lady identified herself as feeling that weight and pressure.

I went over to pray and minister with the lady. As I prayed with the lady asking God to help her hand over her circumstances that she was feeling the pressure from and for the Holy Spirit to release the tension in her shoulders and neck resulting from her circumstances the pain and stiffness released from her shoulders.

Another lady also responded to neck problems saying that she had been having problems with her neck for several days since the last meeting. I prayed and commanded the trapezium muscle to relax and lengthen and the pain left her.
