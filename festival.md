## Reading Festival 2016 Outreach

This year we are out again reaching out to the festival-goers.

We are joining forces again to reach out to the 80,000 people who descend on Reading each year for the Reading Festival.
  Together we are setting up a programme of outreach where we hope to see dozens if not hundreds turn to Jesus this year.
  Please see the events listed below for where and when we are out.</p>
