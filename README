Meet at the (Carey Centre)[http://www.careybaptistchurch.org.uk/] for prayer at 11:00am **????** hiring the streets shortly after. Car parking is available at the Carey Centre.


## Arrangements for Tesco Booze Run Outreach
On Thursday and Friday late mornings/ lunchtimes most Festival-goers turn up at Tesco's, Oxford Road to stock up on alcohol for the week. After queuing in Tesco's they normally relax on the grass outside before slowly making their way back to site.

I am leading a team of Christians who wish to do some 1-2-1 witnessing (and exercising their prophecy and healing gifts if appropriate).

> When

Thursday 25th & Friday 26th late mornings /lunchtime.

> Where

Meet at *The Gate, Oxford Road* (553 Oxford Road, RG30 1HJ) at 11:30.

Some members of the team  will be there from 10:30 to train anybody who wants to join in the evangelism but feels unprepared.

Limited parking is available at The Gate and there ought to be some parking in Tesco's car park (RG1 7LA).


## Arrangements for Riverside Outreach


If we have large numbers of evangelists want to join in we will consider splitting the outreach into a Town Centre Team and a Riverside Team.

> When

- Wednesday  24th (RFC, Turning Team, )
- Thursday 25th
- Friday 26th
- Saturday 27th (with Carey & HOTS)
- Sunday 28th (Carey)

> Where

Meet 1-2pm at XXXX church where the team have been taking a lunchtime break following the morning outreach

We will be leaving for the short walk to the riverside just before 2pm for 2 hours or so of outreach by the Riverside.
