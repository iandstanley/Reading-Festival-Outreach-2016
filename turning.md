<em>The Turning</em> is the name of a group of Christians from the following churches:

- [Lifespring](http://www.lifespringchurch.org.uk)
- [Network Vineyard](http://www.networkvineyard.org.uk)
- [Reading Family churches](http://www.readingfamilychurch.org.uk)
- [The Gate](http://www.thegate.uk.com)

They are passionate about the lost and want to reach them for Jesus. They believe absolutely in the Great Commission:

> 15 And he said to them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. 16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 17 And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 18 they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.” – Mark 16 (ESV)

They hold to Jesus' commandment to baptism of the Holy Spirit as a integral part of evangelism and that by Him we are empowered to become Jesus' witnesses.

> 4 And while staying[a] with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, “you heard from me; 5 for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with[b] the Holy Spirit not many days from now.” ... 8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” – Acts 1 (ESV)

The Team was setup to help facilitate the process of Christians being renewed in the Holy Spirit and encouraging them to witness both on the street, at work and school by running worship and training sessions in Reading and beyond. At the time of this website commencing the team has trained over 800 Christians how to simply witness to anyone and those 800+ christians have seen over 2,000 of the lost of Reading come to faith in Jesus in a little over 2 months.

The team regularly runs worship and Holy Spirit soaking sessions in Reading as well as evangelism training and outreach.

The Turning team has also been invited to many cities in the UK and abroad to train Christians in evangelism and the Great Commission.
